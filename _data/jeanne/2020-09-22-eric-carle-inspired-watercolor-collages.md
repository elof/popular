Eric Carle is ubiquitous amongst children's literature. For good reason because of the lighthearted content and the whimiscal illustrations. I'm sure most people can count The Little Hungry Catepillar as one of their earliest reads. When I stumbled onto this [Eric Carle inspired watercolor collage activity](https://www.carlemuseum.org/blogs/making-art/watercolor-painted-collage-papers), I knew we had to try it. This activity had multiple steps but we just spaced it out to two days. Although you could always do the first part of painting in the morning and then make the collage in the afternoon. Anyway, let's get to it!

### Supplies needed:

* Tracing paper
* Liquid watercolors
* Paintbrush
* Scissors
* Glue 

### Steps:

1. Paint the tracing paper with liquid watercolors. We painted many sheets in a variety of colors. The tutorial we followed called for using crayons to rub textures onto paper but we skipped that step.

2. Let tracing paper dry. We placed it in the sun so it sped up drying time. 

Tip: You can also use a blowdryer if you want to keep going with the activity instead of waiting for tracing paper to air dry. 

3. Once the tracing paper is dry, you can use your scissors to cut out different shapes for your collage.

4. Now it's time to assemble your collage. We like to lay out our design on paper before glueing but you can just glue as you go.

And that's it. This is how ours turned out. Kiddo and I both made two.

I like how they turned out so colorful and vibrant. Let me know if you try it. And takes for stopping by. Bye!
