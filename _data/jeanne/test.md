Hi! Glad you found us. You are probably here because you have found yourself at some point at the store staring at a million options of whatever arts and crafts materials. You are paralyzed by decision fatigue and mabye just want someone to tell you what to get? Well, it’s your lucky day. Here’s a list of arts and crafts supplies that we use. This is not an exhaustive list as there are so many options of any art medium you can think of but we make a lot of art so this stuff definitely holds up to tons of use by an art obsessed preschooler. We love these items and they get our seal of approval.

 Let’s get started, shall we?
