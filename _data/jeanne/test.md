Hi! Glad you found us. You are probably here because you have found yourself at some point at the store staring at a million options of whatever arts and crafts material that you went there for in the first place. Decision fatigue is a real thing guys. Well, it’s your lucky day. Here’s a list of arts and crafts materials we have and love. This is not an exhaustive list as there are so many options of any art medium you can think of but we do a lot of art so this stuff definitely holds up to a lot of use by an art obsessed preschooler. 

I also included a bunch of items that I have had experience with as a former preschool teacher.
