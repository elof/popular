Hi! Glad you found us. You are probably here because you have found yourself at some point at the store staring at a million options for art supplies on the shelves. You’re stuck and just want someone to tell you what to get. Well, it’s your lucky day. Here’s a list of arts and crafts materials that we have used and think are great. This is not an exhaustive list as there are so many types of any art medium you can imagine. There definitely will be a Part 2 & 3 of this post but this is a good start.

We do a lot of art so this stuff definitely holds up to a lot of use by an art obsessed preschooler. I have organized the items in this list into common art supplies categories for easy browsing. These are some basic items to get kids started on open-ended art. As with any art supplies there is a suggested age range but I think that with some adult supervision most supplies can be used with most kids but use your best judgement with say permanent markers and stuff of the like.  With that said, let’s get started, shall we?

### Paper

1. **Construction Paper**: We got this [Colorations Construction Paper Pack](https://amzn.to/34BRDDG) to go with her other basic colored construction paper because it’s so bright and vibrant. Also, it’s super heavy weight makes cutting easier because the paper doesn’t flop around as much.
2. **Mixed Media Paper**: I like getting these [Arteza Mixed Media Sketch Book](https://amzn.to/3gBpLSp) for my kid because it makes for a nice keepsake that is contained in one neat place. Also, we’ve used this mixed media paper with oil pastels, tempura paint, watercolor paint, you name it—it’s superior quality. I’m impressed with how well it withstands any art medium that is used on it. I leave a couple in my kid’s art cart and she grabs them and adds new doodles/art to them every so often. 
3. **Easel Paper Rolls**: We got the [Melissa & Doug Easel Paper Rolls ](https://amzn.to/2Qt0yiw)initially as part of a set that came with the Melissa & Doug easel but we’ve gone back to this one after trying other brands because it’s heavy duty and can withstand layers and layers of paint. 
4. **Color Cardstock**: We got these [Crayola Cardstock Paper](https://amzn.to/2YCxVnL) for their colorful and fun designs. Each pattern in the set of 25 sheets is different. We’ve used them for so many different projects. They’re heavy weight and acid free too.
5. **Watercolor Paper**: This [Canson XL Series Watercolor Pad](https://amzn.to/3gAFwJs) is my favorite budget watercolor paper. We prefer these over kid specific watercolor paper because it’s heavy enough to handle wash after wash of paint and just an overall good quality student grade paper with a textured surface. Mama and kid both use it.
6. **White Paper**: We use good old printer paper for everyday doodles. This ream of [AmazonBasics Multipurpose Copy Printer Paper](https://amzn.to/2YA9AyA) does a decent job. It’s medium weight, bright, and a good value. I don’t know about you but my kid goes through so much white paper.

### Paint and Paint supplies

1. **Tempura Paint**: We love crayola anything. This [Crayola Premier Tempera Paint](https://amzn.to/3gwfIyd) is no exception. It’s thick and pigmented. We like to get the squeeze bottles to refill the little containers of paint on kid’s easel.
2. **Acrylic Paint**: We like this [Crayola Acrylic Paint Set](https://amzn.to/2QvCATG) for when we need paint that is permanent. There are different sets that come in such rich and pretty tones. 
3. **Easel**: All kids need an easel. This is by far one of the art things that gets the most mileage. Kid’s grandma got her this [Melissa & Doug Deluxe Wooden Standing Art Easel](https://amzn.to/2FXvvcF) at 18 months old and a few years later we’re still going strong with creating amazing paintings with it. I like it for its compartments for painting supplies, white board, chalkboard with tray for chalk, and it’s sturdiness. 
4. **Kids Art Smocks**: Messy art is fun but sometimes you want to keep the paint off those cute little outfits that kids wear. These [art smocks](https://amzn.to/2Qp4LE5) used to double as meal time smocks/bibs when my kid was little. They’re easy to clean.
5. **Watercolor Paints**: Of course as a watercolorist I absolutely had to get my kid a good watercolor set. This [ARTEZA Kids Premium Watercolor Paint Set](https://amzn.to/3hsc4qi) is so good. The viscosity of paint is wonderful and the colors are amazingly vibrant. I know there are cheaper sets but I absolutely recommend getting higher quality paints for kids. Results are much prettier.
6. **Paint Roller**: This definitely falls into the category of miscellaneous and unnecessary for a basic art kit but we did a printmaking activity once with this [Falling in Art Rubber Roller Brayer](https://amzn.to/2EsNqHS) and I was impressed at how well it held up to my kid’s rough handling. Super solid and easy for little hands to roll. 
7. **Block Printing Paint**- Again, this [Sax True Flow Water Soluble Block Printing Ink](https://amzn.to/2Ex4Ra6) is an unnecessary art supply but if you’re looking for this type of paint we like this brand for its smooth application and quick drying time.
8. **Sponges**: I like to get a variety of painting apparatus for my kid to use. These [Synthetic Sponges for Painting & Crafts](https://amzn.to/32ql9cU) is great because it comes in 3 different sizes. It’s dense and moves the paint around paper pretty well. 
9. **Paint Brush Variety Pack**: We like this [Crayola Kids Paint Brushes Set](https://amzn.to/2ECCUxo) because it comes in a few different sizes. My kid likes to interchange them to make a different size markings and strokes. 
10. **Washable Paint**: Washable is the key word, am I right? If your kid is anything like mine, they will inevitably paint on themselves. Having some kind of removable paint like [Crayola Washable Kids Paint](https://amzn.to/34FfIcP) is essential. No brainer, next!
11. **Paint Containers**: These [Melissa & Doug Spill Proof Paint Cups](https://amzn.to/3hy1WMS) were crucial in the early years of my budding artist’s life when she had major butter fingers and spilled paint everywhere. And now they’re just little paint recepticles that stay at the easel.
12. **Large Paint Brushes**: This [Melissa & Doug Large Paint Brush Set](https://amzn.to/2EADITt) was my little’s first paint brushes. She still uses them. They are easy to grip, have a long handle, and have been used to paint many a masterpiece. Great first brushes that last for many years.

### Drawing and Coloring

1. **Oil Pastels**: I love oil pastels. The creamy texture on paper and the way you can smudge it. It’s such a versatile art medium. Anyway, my kid has these [Oil Pastel Twisty Stix](https://amzn.to/34zRBML). They’re the best. Since they’re twist up you can store them without worrying that they will make a mess of the container they’re in. 
2. **Acrylic Pens :** We’re big on painting rocks here. And using these [Acrylic Paint Marker](https://amzn.to/2EkgT6V) is a perfect portable way to paint without the mess. 
3. **Rubbing Plates**: Use these [Texture Rubbing Plates](https://amzn.to/2EtN8jZ) to make your own pattern paper. Each plate comes with two halves that are different motifs so you really get a lot of variation. 
4. **Permanent Markers**: I’m sure every parent would say, “are your crazy?” about me saying that you should get these for a kid’s art supplies. Of course, let them use it only with adult supervision. We got these [Crayola Take Note Colored Permanent Marker Set](https://amzn.to/34B76UI) and they work great on a variety of surfaces, e.g. if you want to upcycle that milk jug into some window suncatchers. And they cost a few bucks less than Sharpies brand. Win win. 
5. **Colored Pencils**: These [Derwent Colored Pencils](https://amzn.to/32sfnYh) are our favorite because the colors are bright and they are water soluble so you can use water to blend colors. And they work on a variety of surfaces. I love double duty art materials. 
6. **Tempura Paint Sticks**: We first encountered these [Kwik Stix Solid Tempera Paint Sticks](https://amzn.to/3loVmua) at a little buddy’s house and I fell in love with the thick and rich colors. They are short and easy to grip for little hands. Also, they’re low mess and dry so quickly. 
7. **Sidewalk Chalk**: I love these [Crayola 24 Count Sidewalk Chalk](https://amzn.to/2QrzS1F) they just have so much color payoff. We’ve used so many different types of sidewalk chalk and this is the best one hands down.  [](https://amzn.to/2QrzS1F)
8. **Washable Markers**: They had me at washable. Crayola simply makes the best markers. These [Crayola Ultra-Clean Washable Markers](https://amzn.to/2QtfE7G) really do wash out every time. Because I don’t know about you but I’ve had “washable” markers not come out before. So, rest assured this does! Yay. 
9. **Dabbing Markers**: These [Do A Dot Art! Markers](https://amzn.to/34yTHfO) were one of my kid’s first art supplies. They’re nice a fat for easy gripping and the sponge dauber is durable. And they last forever. 
10. **Crayons**: These [Ooly Easy to Hold Crayon](https://amzn.to/2D5VTA1) are cool not only because they color well but they’re ergonomically correct. So great for little ones but also a fun shape suitable for older kids too.  [](https://amzn.to/2D5VTA1)

![](/assets/Manipulatives.png)

### Manipulatives

1. **Oven Baked Clay**: Sculpey clay is a great way to work on those fine motor skills. Make little figures and shapes then bake them to make a forever keepsake. This [Sculpey Classic Multipack](https://amzn.to/2EHoPi4) has so many colors, it’s a good starter set.  [](https://amzn.to/2EHoPi4)
2. **Water Beads**: These [Marvelbeads Water Beads](https://amzn.to/3lq7LhQ) are a sensory bin favorite around here. Squishy and colorful.
3. **Shaving Foam**: Shaving foam is versatile as a sensory bin type activity and also an art material you can use to make stuff like homemade puffy paint or marble prints. We buy [Gillette Foamy Regular Shaving Foam](https://amzn.to/3lkom6s) in bulk so we always have an easy activity I can pull out for the kid.   [](https://amzn.to/3lq7LhQ)
4. **Fine Motor Tools**: Scaffold the sensory activitiles with tools that kids can use to cut, mold, shape, etc. We have this set [Learning Resources Helping Hands Fine Motor Tool Set Toy](https://amzn.to/2YAPHHZ) and it yields long periods of uninterrupted play, did you hear that? No? Quiet...ahhhhhhh. [](https://amzn.to/2YAPHHZ)

![](/assets/Glue, Tape, and Adhesives.png)

### [](https://amzn.to/2YAPHHZ)Glue, adhesives, and tape

1. **Glue**: My kid uses so much glue so we get these large jugs of [Elmer's Multi-Purpose Glue-All ](https://amzn.to/2YBS0ue)to refill the little bottles. Economical and cuts down on plastic. [](https://amzn.to/2YBS0ue)
2. **Tacky Glue**: I learned about [Aleene's Tacky Glue](https://amzn.to/32sev5X) from my days as a preschool teacher. For those times that regular glue just won’t [](https://amzn.to/32sev5X)do the trick. This stuff is as it’s name suggested sticky and we’ve used it to glue buttons, plastic gems, pom poms, you name it. [](https://amzn.to/32sev5X)
3. **Washi Tape**: I guess [Washi Tape](https://amzn.to/3lzVPtU) could be considered a non-essential but  is so much fun to have because it comes in so many different designs and colors. It’s easy for little hands to tear. What’s not to love? [](https://amzn.to/3lzVPtU)
4. **Tape Stand**: There was one of these  [8 Roll 1-inch Tape Holder](https://amzn.to/34zwkCH) at the preschool I worked at and the kids loved it. They made so many cool creations with tape.
5. **Masking Tape**: [Colorful tape](https://amzn.to/32dQwZb) for that tape holder in bright fun colors.

### Arts and crafts

1. **Foam Stickers**: I got these [Colorful Glitter Foam Stickers](https://amzn.to/32OvfVo) to add to our basic colored ones. They are so damn shiny it makes me smile every time we use them. I know I’m crazy because I do have a love/hate relationship with glitter, these shed a little glitter but how can you be mad at something so pretty. 
2. **Contact Paper**: [Contact paper](https://amzn.to/3377Uy0) is just nice to have around to do fun low mess art activities. Just google contact paper activities, it’ll blow your mind the number of ways you can use this material. Doubles as a sensory item because of the stickiness. Another easy activity for slow days. 
3. **Craft Sand**: This [CuteyCo Crafty Sand](https://amzn.to/2YBL4x0) is hands down in the top 5 art materials my kid loves the most. She asks to use this stuff all the time. I say yes maybe 50% of the time because it is messy. We primarily use it to make sand and glue art (a future tutorial) but I’m certain it can be used in a sensory bin. [](https://amzn.to/2YBL4x0)
4. **Pipettes**: These were mine from my watercolor painting days. I used them to pipe water into my palette. But we found many uses for these [Thin Plastic Transfer Pipettes](https://amzn.to/3gtIhfz) for my kid’s art projects too. We try to reuse them as much as possible usually good for 2-3 uses but eventually they get liquid stuck in them but since this set comes with so many you’ll probably be able to use them forever.
5. **Foam Trays**: I initially got these [Hygloss Products Foam Trays](https://amzn.to/3lq0GOi) to try printmaking myself. Never got to it and did the activity with my kid and she loved it. You can definitely use these for art trays and art storage too.  [](https://amzn.to/3lq0GOi)
6. **Puffy Stickers**: I have a love/hate relationship with stickers. In general, I think they’re fun and how much more fun if they’re a step up from two dimensional. I like this set of [Puffy Stickers](https://amzn.to/2EtphRw), they’re a bit pricier than some of the other stuff you find on Amazon but I like the colors and the designs are cute and don’t look janky. [](https://amzn.to/2EtphRw)
7. **Squeeze Bottles**: Get yourself some  [Plastic Squeeze Bottles](https://amzn.to/3aZYsA8), they’re good for many uses like storing paint, puffy paint, glue, liquid watercolor, etc. I like these because the plastic is thick and they’re large.
8. **Embroidery Hoops**: This set of [Embroidery Hoops](https://amzn.to/3gskpJb) is a cheap and sturdy set that we’ve used quite a few times. One of the top activities we do with these hoops is “sewing”. Such a good fine motor activity. [](https://amzn.to/3gskpJb)
9. **Sewing Needles**: I like these [Plastic Yarn Sewing Needle Set](https://amzn.to/2FXDqqp) because they’re large, easy for little hands and safe for kid use. [](https://amzn.to/2FXDqqp)
10. **Straws**: I cut these [Paper Jumbo Smoothie Straws](https://amzn.to/3gBCx3j) up into small pieces for stringing and making necklaces. Another tried and true kid activity that most kids seem to like. [](https://amzn.to/3gBCx3j)
11. **Pony Beads**: We use for necklaces. This set of [Pony Beads](https://amzn.to/2Qrwkwj) is a good value with lots of colors.
12. **Craft Rolls**: I mean, yes of course you can use toilet rolls but these [Craft Rolls](https://amzn.to/3jlDUFp) are sturdier.[](https://amzn.to/3jlDUFp)
13. **Stamp Pad**: We like this [Melissa & Doug Rainbow Stamp Pad](https://amzn.to/2El4Qq0) because it has lots of colors and is all in one large Pad for easy storage. Oh, and it’s washable. Yes. [](https://amzn.to/2El4Qq0)
14. **Tissue Paper**: Not to be mistaken for regular tissue paper, [Hygloss Products Bleeding Tissue Assortment](https://amzn.to/3jiHn7o) does amazing things when mixed with water. Leaves the most beautiful hints of color for a watercolor effect. [](https://amzn.to/3jiHn7o)
15. **Stencils**: This [Melissa & Doug Stencil Art Coloring Activity Kit](https://amzn.to/3gyEQEr) was one of the items we got for an activity to do on a camping trip. The stencils are thick and it comes with a storage pouch. A nice portable activity for when you’re out and about. 
16. **Paper Punchers**: We use these [Scrapbook Paper 1 Inch Paper Punches](https://amzn.to/3jpUHqz) to make our own confetti for collages and such. My kid can do it herself because the lever is easy to push. My favorite kind of art supply is one that my kid doesn’t need my help with.  [](https://amzn.to/3jpUHqz)

![](/assets/Art Storage.png)

### Art storage

1. **Art Caddy**: We have this [Learning Resources Create-a-Space Storage Center](https://amzn.to/2G0MGKp)  to store art supplies that my kid can move around the house with her. It’s also a good solution for when you have little space. I like that it’s large and colorful. [](https://amzn.to/2G0MGKp)
2. **Art Cart**: This [Honey-Can-Do Rolling Storage Cart and Organizer](https://amzn.to/2YF0bGg)  is home to all the stuff that doesn’t fit in the smaller art cart in my kid’s room. I like the two different sized storage. For the price it’s works ok. [](https://amzn.to/2YF0bGg)
3. **Storage Bins**: I use these  [Interlocking bin Customizable Multi-Purpose Storage ](https://amzn.to/31AhIRI)to separate all the art stuff in her little art cart that’s in her room. I like that they interlock and you can rearrange them in different configurations.
4. **Paper Storage**: These [SimpleHouseware Magazine File Holder Organizer Box ](https://amzn.to/2Qu82C7) are good for storing the millions of different types of paper we have. [](https://amzn.to/2Qu82C7)
