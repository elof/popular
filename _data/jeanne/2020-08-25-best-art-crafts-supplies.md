Hi! Glad you found us. You are probably here because you have found yourself at some point at the store staring at a million art supplies on the shelves and get stuck. You just want someone to tell you what to get. Well, it’s your lucky day. Here’s a list of arts and crafts materials that we have used and think are great. This is not an exhaustive list as there are so many options of any art medium you can imagine. There definitely will be a Part 2 & 3 of this post but this is a good start. We do a lot of art so this stuff definitely holds up to a lot of use by an art obsessed preschooler. Included in the mix is some non-essential supplies, toys, and games but since it’s pandemic time there’s so much time to do fun things, so I thought why not if you want to level up your arts/crafts game.

If we post an affiliate link to a product, rest assured that it is something that I would personally buy and use without an affiliate commission. I am just a passionate former preschool teacher and mama that loves all things kid art related. 

With that said, let’s get started, shall we?
