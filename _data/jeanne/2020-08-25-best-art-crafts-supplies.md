Hi! Glad you found us. You are probably here because you have found yourself at some point at the store staring at a million art supplies on the shelves and get stuck. You just want someone to tell you what to get. Well, it’s your lucky day. Here’s a list of arts and crafts materials that we have used and think are great. This is not an exhaustive list as there are so many options of any art medium you can imagine. There definitely will be a Part 2 & 3 of this post but this is a good start. 

We do a lot of art so this stuff definitely holds up to a lot of use by an art obsessed preschooler. Included in the mix is some non-essential supplies, toys, and games but since it’s pandemic life there’s so much time to do fun things, so I thought why not. 

I have organized the items in this list into common art supplies categories for easy browsing. These are some basic items to get kids started on open-ended art. With that said, let’s get started, shall we?

I am just a passionate former preschool teacher and mama that loves all things kid art related.

### Paper

1. **Construction Paper**: We got this [Colorations Construction Paper Pack](https://amzn.to/34BRDDG) to go with her other basic colored construction paper because it’s so bright and vibrant. Also, it’s super heavy weight makes cutting easier because the paper doesn’t flop around as much. 
2. **Easel Paper Rolls**: We got there [Melissa & Doug Easel Paper Rolls ](https://amzn.to/2Qt0yiw)initially as part of a set that came with the Melissa & Doug easel but we’ve gone back to this one after trying other brands because it’s heavy duty and can withstand layers and layers of paint. 
3. **Watercolor Paper**: This [Canson XL Series Watercolor Pad](https://amzn.to/3gAFwJs) is my favorite budget watercolor paper. We prefer these over kid specific watercolor paper because it’s heavy enough to wash after wash of paint and just an overall good quality student grade paper with a textured surface. Mama and kid both use it.
4. **Mixed Media Paper**: I like getting these [Arteza Mixed Media Sketch Book](https://amzn.to/3gBpLSp) for my kid because it makes for a nice keepsake that is contained in one neat place. Also, we’ve used this mixed media paper with oil pastels, tempura paint, watercolor paint, you name it—it’s superior quality. I’m impressed with how well it withstands any art medium that is used on it. I leave a couple in my kid’s art cart and she grabs them and adds to them every so often. 
5. **Color Cardstock**: We got these [Crayola Cardstock Paper](https://amzn.to/2YCxVnL) for their colorful and fun designs. Each pattern in the set of 25 sheets is different. We’ve used them for so many different projects. They’re heavy weight and acid free too.
6. **White Paper**: We use good old printer paper for everyday doodles. This ream of [AmazonBasics Multipurpose Copy Printer Paper](https://amzn.to/2YA9AyA) does a decent job. It’s medium weight, bright, and a good value. I don’t know about you but my kid goes through so much white paper.

### Paint and Paint supplies

1. **Tempura Paint**: We love crayola anything. This [Crayola Premier Tempera Paint](https://amzn.to/3gwfIyd) is no exception. It’s thick and pigmented. We like to get the squeeze bottles to refill the little containers of paint on kid’s easel.
2. **Acrylic Paint**: We like this [Crayola Acrylic Paint Set](https://amzn.to/2QvCATG) for when we need paint that is permanent. There are diffrent sets that come in such rich and pretty tones. 
3. **Easel**: All kids need an easel. This is by far one of the art things that gets the most mileage. Kid’s grandma got her this [Melissa & Doug Deluxe Wooden Standing Art Easel](https://amzn.to/2FXvvcF) at 18 months old and a few years later we’re still going strong with creating amazing paintings with it. I like it for it’s compartments for painting supplies, white board, chalkboard with tray for chalk, and it’s sturdiness. 
4. **Kids Art Smocks**: Messy art is fun but sometimes you want to keep the paint off those cute little outfits that kids wear. These [art smocks](https://amzn.to/2Qp4LE5) used to double as meal time smocks/bibs when my kid was little. They’re easy to clean.
5. **Watercolor Paints**: Of course as a watercolorist I absolutely had to get my kid a good watercolor set. This [ARTEZA Kids Premium Watercolor Paint Set](https://amzn.to/3hsc4qi) is so good. The paints viscosity of paint is wonderful and the colors are amazingly vibrant. I know there are cheaper sets but I absolutely recommend getting higher quality paints for kids. Results are much prettier.
6. **Paint Roller**: This definitely falls into the category of miscellaneous and unnecessary for a basic art kit but we did a printmaking activity once with this [Falling in Art Rubber Roller Brayer](https://amzn.to/2EsNqHS) and I was impressed at how well it held up to my kid’s rough handling. Super solid and easy for little hands to roll. 
7. **Block Printing Paint**- Again, this [Sax True Flow Water Soluble Block Printing Ink](https://amzn.to/2Ex4Ra6) is an unnecessary art supply but if you’re looking for this type of paint we like this brand for its smooth application and quick drying time.
8. **Sponges**: I like to get a variety of painting apparatus for my kid to use. These [Synthetic Sponges for Painting & Crafts](https://amzn.to/32ql9cU) is great because it comes in 3 different sizes. It’s dense and moves the paint around paper pretty well. 
9. **Paint Brush Variety Pack**: We like this [Crayola Kids Paint Brushes Set](https://amzn.to/2ECCUxo) because it comes in a few different sizes. My kid likes to interchange them to make a different size markings and strokes. 
10. **Washable Paint**: Washable is the key word, am I right? If your kid is anything like mine, they will invariably paint on themselves. Having some kind of removable paint like [Crayola Washable Kids Paint](https://amzn.to/34FfIcP) is essential. No brainer, next!
11. **Paint Containers**: These [Melissa & Doug Spill Proof Paint Cups](https://amzn.to/3hy1WMS) were crucial in the early years of my budding artist’s life when she had major butter fingers and spilled paint everywhere. And now they’re just little paint recepticles that stay at the easel.d
12. **Large Paint Brushes**: This [Melissa & Doug Large Paint Brush Set](https://amzn.to/2EADITt) was my little’s first paint brushes. She still uses them. They are sturdy and have been used to paint many a masterpiece. Great first brushes that last for many years.

### Drawing and Coloring

1. **Oil Pastels**: I love oil pastels. The creamy texture on a paper and the way you can smudge it. It’s such a versatile art medium. Anyway, my kid has these Oil Pastel Twisty Stix. They’re the best. Since they’re twist up you can store them without worrying that they will make a mess of the container they’re in. 
2. **Acrylic Pens :** We’re big on painting rocks here. And using these Acrylic Paint Marker is a perfect portable way to paint without the mess. 
3. **Rubbing Plates**: Use these Texture Rubbing Plates to make your own pattern paper. Each plate comes with two halves that are different motifs so you really get a lot of variation. 
4. **Permanent Markers**: I’m sure every parent would say, “are your crazy?” about me saying that you should get these for a kid’s art supplies. Of course, let them use it only with adult supervision. We got these Crayola Take Note Colored Permanent Marker Set and they work great on a variety of surfaces, e.g. if you want to upcycle that milk jug into some window suncatchers. And they cost a few bucks less than Sharpies. Win win. 
5. **Colored Pencils**: Derwent Colored Pencils
6. **Tempura Paint Sticks**: Kwik Stix Solid Tempera Paint
7. **Washable Markers**: Crayola Ultra-Clean Washable Markers
8. **Dabbing Markers**: Do A Dot Art! Markers
