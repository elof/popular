Everyone knows the vinegar and baking soda science activity. Well, I found this version of that activity but with a fun twist: little plastic dinosaurs! Here's the [tutorial](https://www.thebestideasforkids.com/fizzy-dinosaur-eggs/) from [The best ideas for KIDS](https://www.thebestideasforkids.com) website. My kid LOVED "hatching" the eggs. But here's the best part, she went and got herself a measuring cup and a spoon from the kitchen and extended this short activity for another 30 minutes. It's a good thing I bought a giant size jug of vinegar and a 3.5 lb bag of baking soda. You can easily grab these supplies while on a grocery shopping trip. Anyway, follow along if you want to see our process.

#### Supplies needed:

* [Baking soda](https://www.target.com/p/arm-38-hammer-pure-baking-soda-3-5lb/-/A-50259963#lnk=sametab) (you should get a large bag at the grocery story instead of those tiny boxes)
* [Vinegar](https://www.target.com/p/white-distilled-vinegar-128oz-good-38-gather-8482/-/A-54633873#lnk=sametab) (again, get the largest jug you can find)
* Pipettes, squirt bottles, medicine syringes (more on which ones worked best for us later)
* [Gel food coloring](https://www.target.com/p/wilton-neon-gel-food-color-set-4ct/-/A-14936449#lnk=sametab) (optional)

#### Steps:

1. Put a few drops of each color in separate bowls.
2. Mix the food color with 2 Tbsp of water then add 1/2 cup of baking soda. Mix well until you have a coarse mixture. 

   Tip: This mixture was only enough to make 1 egg of each color. Maybe because our dinosaurs were bigger. We used 2-2.5" dinosaurs. Next time I'll double or triple the ingredients. 
3. Now, form your eggs by grabbing a bunch of the wet mixture and closing your fist around it to make an egg shape. 

   Tip: We had a tough time with this part because the baking soda mixture was too dry and had to add more water. So don't be afraid to adjust the mixture as needed.
4. We made another batch of plain white eggs because there wasn't enough baking soda paste to make more than one of each color. You can do this by mixing together 1 cup of baking soda and 1/4 cup of water. 
5. Now comes the fun part, you get to "hatch" the eggs. 

   Tip: A medicine syringe (you know the ones that come with the liquid kid's tyelnol) worked best for my kid. She lacked the dexterity to squeeze the pipette to get enough vinegar to make baking soda fizz. And a squirt bottle dumped too much vinegar all at once. 
6. Keep going! Just because the dinosaurs hatched doesn't mean the activity is over. My kid got a spoon and a cup and stayed working on this for a long while. She was erupting "volcanoes".
