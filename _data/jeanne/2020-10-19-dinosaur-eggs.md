Everyone knows the vinegar and baking soda science activity. Well, I found this version of that activity but with a fun twist: little plastic dinosaurs! Here's the [tutorial](https://www.thebestideasforkids.com/fizzy-dinosaur-eggs/) from [The best ideas for KIDS](https://www.thebestideasforkids.com) website. My kid LOVED "hatching" the eggs. But here's the best part, she went and got herself a measuring cup and a spoon from the kitchen and extended this short activity for another 30 minutes. It's a good thing I bought a giant size jug of vinegar and a 3.5 lb bag of baking soda. Anyway, follow along if you want to see our process.
