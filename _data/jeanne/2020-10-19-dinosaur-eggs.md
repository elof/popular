Everyone knows the vinegar and baking soda science activity. Well, I found this version of that activity but with a fun twist: little plastic dinosaurs! Here's the [tutorial](https://www.thebestideasforkids.com/fizzy-dinosaur-eggs/) from [The best ideas for KIDS](https://www.thebestideasforkids.com) website. My kid LOVED "hatching" the eggs. But here's the best part, she went and got herself a measuring cup and a spoon from the kitchen and extended this short activity for another 30 minutes. It's a good thing I bought a giant size jug of vinegar and a 3.5 lb bag of baking soda. You can easily grab these supplies while on a grocery shopping trip. Anyway, follow along if you want to see our process.

#### Supplies needed:

* [Baking soda](https://www.target.com/p/arm-38-hammer-pure-baking-soda-3-5lb/-/A-50259963#lnk=sametab) (you should get a large bag at the grocery story instead of those tiny boxes)
* [Vinegar](https://www.target.com/p/white-distilled-vinegar-128oz-good-38-gather-8482/-/A-54633873#lnk=sametab) (again, get the largest jug you can find)
* Pipettes, squirt bottles, medicine syringes (more on which ones worked best for us later)
* [Gel food coloring](https://www.target.com/p/wilton-neon-gel-food-color-set-4ct/-/A-14936449#lnk=sametab) (optional)
