I saw this idea on one of my favorite kid art blogs [Art Bar](https://www.artbarblog.com/watercolor-paper-pinwheels/) and knew that kiddo and I had to try it. Watercolors are just so pretty and pinwheels remind me of party decor aka happy times. Overall, this was a good activity for my kid. Usually I try to involve my little in as much of the making process as possible, but she had a bit of trouble folding so I did most of it. She did help me staple and painted her pinwheels solo so it was a good semi-process art type of craft in the end.
