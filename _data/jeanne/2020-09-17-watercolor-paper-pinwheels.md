I saw this idea on one of my favorite kid art blogs [Art Bar](https://www.artbarblog.com/watercolor-paper-pinwheels/) and knew that kiddo and I had to try it. Watercolors are just so pretty and pinwheels remind me of party decor aka happy times. Overall, this was a good activity for my kid. Usually I try to involve my little in as much of the making process as possible, but she had a bit of trouble folding so I did most of it. Instead of glueing the fans together we opted to staple them. Kiddo did helped staple and painted her pinwheels solo so it was a good semi-process art type of craft in the end.

### Supplies needed:

* Watercolor paper or mixed media paper
* Stapler/Staples
* Any watercolors you have on hand (we used this liquid watercolor set and this ikea watercolor palette)
* Hole punch
* Ribbon

### Steps for making the watercolor pinwheels:

1. Your sheet of watercolor paper should be close to 6"x9" as possible. If it's not this size trim it. You will need four sheets.
2. Fold the watercolor sheet in half lengthwise. Crease it well because it will be the guide to fold the accordian in half. 
3. Unfold sheet.
4. Fold sheet in half width wise. 
5. Then fold sheet in 1/2 into 4 equal sections. 
6. Then fold those 4 sections in halve to make 8 equal sections.
7. Now fold your accordian in half. 
8. Use a stapler to connect the accordian to make a fan. Repeat steps 1-8 to make 3 more fans. 
9. Now staple all for fans together to complete your pinwheel.

In the end your pinwheel should look something like this. Yes, I know there's a gaping center but we're happy with the result. We're not going for perfection here.

Now, you paint! Make sure you get in between all the folds so that your pinwheel is colorful all over. If you want the vibrant color that you see on ours, use less water and more liquid watercolor paint.

We tried painting some with watercolor pans which yielded a paler effect but still very pretty!

Now use your hole punch and make a hole where you can string ribbon to hang up your colorful creation.

And here she is. So easy to make and looks wonderful hanging in a doorway or in your window
