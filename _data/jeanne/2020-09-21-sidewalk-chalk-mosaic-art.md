Sidewalk chalk has always been a staple in our arsenal of art supplies. It's easy to use, low mess, and fun for all ages. During the begin of quarantine, sidewalk chalk was one of those hard to find items like toilet paper and hand sanitizer. All the children were stuck at home and everyone was finding ways to keep their littles occupied. A happy medium of quarantine was being able to sit on the stoop and get fresh air while doodling with sidewalk chalk. Then I saw a mom friend do these nifty chalk "mosaics" on the sidewalk, and we tried it right away. 

We probably did one a day for about a week and a half then the novelty wore off. But whenever we looked out the window and saw people admiring our public art, it made me smile. Anyway, without further ado, if you want to learn how to do this, follow along below.

### Steps:

1. Find a spot on the sidewalk.
2. Tape off your border shape. We made a square because conveniently the sidewalk is divided into squares already but you can make any shape. Go wild with your imagination.
3. Here comes the fun part: creating the "mosaic". Start tearing of strips in varying lengths of masking tape. Place them within your border, making sure that each end of the strip is always touching another piece of tape. 
4. Now you color within each shape! Tip: Before you color, make sure to press down the tape all around your design to make sure the edges are clean when you pull off tape after coloring.
