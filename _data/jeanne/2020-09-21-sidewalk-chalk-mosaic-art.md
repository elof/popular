Sidewalk chalk has always been a staple in our arsenal of art supplies. It's easy to use, low mess, and fun for all ages. During the begin of quarantine, sidewalk chalk was one of those hard to find items like toilet paper and hand sanitizer. All the children were stuck at home and everyone was finding ways to keep their littles occupied. A happy medium of quarantine was being able to sit on the stoop and get fresh air while doodling with sidewalk chalk. Then I saw a mom friend do these nifty chalk "mosaics" on the sidewalk, and we tried it right away. We probably did one a day for about a week and a half then the novelty wore off. Anyway, without further ado, if you want to learn how to do this, follow along below.

### Steps:

1. Tape off your border shape. We made a square because conveniently the sidewalk is divided into squares already but you can make any shape. Go wild with your imagination.

1. Here comes the fun part: creating the "mosaic". Start tearing of strips in varying lengths of masking tape. Place them within your border, making sure that each end of the strip is always touching another piece of tape.

1. Now you color within each shape! 

   Tip: Before you color, make sure to press down the tape all around your design to make sure the edges are clean when you pull off tape after coloring.

2. Peel off tape. This is the most satisfying part.
3. Repeat steps 1-4 until you color your whole sidewalk. I'm not even kidding. We did several over the next few days. Here's the final result:

This photo is after one week in the elements with people walking over it. Lasts quite a long time. Annnndd the thing that brings me the most joy is that most people who saw them stopped to admire them. LOOOOVE that because art is meant to shared. Yaaasss!

Oh, before I go. Make sure you don't color on space that isn't yours. Our mosaic spilled a bit over on the neighbor's property and they got pissed. So we had to hose it down. That's why I don't have pictures of the other mosaics we did. Whoops. =) Anyway, if you try this art project tag me on Instagram @123createwithme. Bye!
