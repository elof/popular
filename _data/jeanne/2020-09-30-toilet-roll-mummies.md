I decided that we would sprinkle some Halloween arts and crafts between our other warm weather cheery crafts. Why? Well, we just can't wait. We love celebrating Halloween. And my kid asked if we could make more spooky decorations. Duh! YES!

So, today we're making toilet roll mummies. These are adorable and so easy to make with regular household items. Things I'm certain you have already. What? You don't hoard toilet rolls for kid crafts? =) Well, start saving them so you can make this with us. Let us show you how.

* Toilet rolls
* [Black paint](https://www.michaels.com/washable-tempera-paint-by-artminds-16oz/10091774.html) (optional)
* [Googly eyes](https://www.michaels.com/wiggle-eyes-assorted-value-pack-by-creatology/10485712.html)

#### Steps:

1. Paint your toilet roll black. This step is optional but I think it makes the mummy look spookier. =)

2. Cut your gauze into varying length strips.

3. Squeeze a bit of glue at the top of toilet roll to start of your wrapping. At the end of each strip, place a few drops of glue to secure it. Keep wrapping and glueing until you reach the bottom of your toilet roll.

4. Find a bit of space where the black underneath is showing and glue on your googly eyes.

And that's it! So simple and quick.

Throwing in a couple more unrelated related photos of my kid painting a cat and spider figures I got at Target. Since we were already painting the mummies black, why not work on these as well. MORE SPOOKY DECORATIONS!
