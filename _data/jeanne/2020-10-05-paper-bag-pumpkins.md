It's officially October (cue the cheering and applause). What that means is that we're going to make Halloween arts and crafts galore. October is my favorite month by far because the weather is still warm where we live but we get the fog in morning and nights are cool. When I think of autumn, first thought that comes to mind is the falling leaves (we're definitely going to do some leaf art in the near future) BUT most of all pumpkins comes to mind. Have you been to Trader Joe's lately? It's pumpkin this and pumpkin that. Can't avoid it. So to mark the beginning of our favorite month, we're making paper bag pumpkins! This is one of my favorite fall/halloween crafts because it's a good way to reuse materials and it's easy enough to involve the kid in every step. Follow along to see how it's done.
