It's officially October (cue the cheering and applause). What that means is that we're going to make Halloween arts and crafts galore. October is my favorite month by far because the weather is still warm where we live but we get the fog in morning and nights are cool. When I think of autumn, first thought that comes to mind is the falling leaves (we're definitely going to do some leaf art in the near future) BUT next pumpkins comes to mind. Have you been to Trader Joe's lately? It's pumpkin this and pumpkin that. Can't avoid it. 

So to mark the beginning of our favorite month, we're making paper bag pumpkins! This is one of my favorite fall/halloween crafts because it's a good way to reuse materials and it's easy enough to involve the kid in every step. Follow along to see how it's done.

3. Stuff the open shopping bags full with the crumpled paper. Keep doing this until you get the size you'd like but make sure it isn't too full (we filled it to about 3/4 full).

4. Grab the top and scrunch it into a stem shape and wrap the top with the green masking tape until it's secure.

6. After your paint is dried, you can cut out your tendrils. Make a lengthwise cut and move all the way about an inch shy of the top the turn your paper. Cut all around until you get to the middle.
