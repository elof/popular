### How to make your UFOs:

1. Turn plate over and use with silver paint to cover entire bottom of plate. No need to paint the top because they’re not going to be showing. Paint 2 plates. Let it dry before moving onto next step.

2. Glue plates together so that the silver concave part of plate is outward. You now have your UFO!

3. Next we’re moving onto to making our little alien that is going to pilot this ship. Glue the googly eyes to your pom pom. We made our own with a pom pom maker but feel free to use store bought. Cut a 1” long pipe cleaner 2x to make the antennae then glue onto pom pom.
