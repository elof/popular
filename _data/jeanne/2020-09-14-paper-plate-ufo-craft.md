Space themed art is always so much fun. And with Halloween just around the corner. This can be part of your spooky decor. This is a multi-step art activity that is sure to keep your kids engaged.. You probably have many of the supplies to make it. If not, they are easy to get items from any store. Have a blast making this adorable craft.

### Supplies:

* paper plates
* clear plastic cups
* silver paint
* paintbrush
* [tacky glue](https://amzn.to/32sev5X)
* googly eyes
* pipe cleaners
* 1” pom poms (we made our own with this pom pom maker but store bought is fine)
* acrylic gems

### How to make your UFOs: 

1. Turn plate over and use with silver paint to cover entire bottom of plate. No need to paint the top because they’re not going to be showing. Let it dry before moving onto next step.

2. Glue plates together so that the silver concave part of plate is outward. You now have your UFO!

3. Next we’re moving onto to making our little alien that is going to pilot this ship. Glue the googly eyes to your pom pom. Cut a 1” long pipe cleaner 2x to make the antennae then glue onto pom pom.
