So I don’t know about you but when my kid’s preschool announced immediate closure due to COVID, my gut reaction was a four letter expletive. At this point, she had been in school for nearly 2 years full time. What in the world were we going to do at home? There was simply too much time and not enough to do. I‘m being facetious but I figured a little toy refresh was in order because these are weird times. The usual new toys only on birthdays and Christmas rule went out the door. 

 I went on a bit of a spending spree and got here some toys and games that would give her some focused activity. Let’s be real, little kids have short attention spans and I wasn’t expecting hours and hours of independent play but I was hoping for enough time to drink my coffee warm. So, I present to you my pandemic toy, game, and activity haul. This kid better not say she’s bored every again.
