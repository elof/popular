So I don’t know about you but when my kid’s preschool announced immediate closure due to COVID in March, my gut reaction was a four letter expletive. At this point, she had been in school for nearly 2 years full time. What in the world were we going to do at home? There was simply too much time and not enough to do. I figured a little toy refresh was in order because these are weird times. The usual new toys only on birthdays and Christmas rule went out the door. 

She lamented on and on about how she missed her friends. So, I went on a bit of a spending spree and got her some new stuff that would give her some focused activity and a pick me up. Let’s be real, little kids have short attention spans and I wasn’t expecting hours and hours of independent play but I was hoping for enough time to drink my coffee warm or do a little social media browsing.

So, I present to you my pandemic toy, game, and book haul. So you don’t think l’m a crazy shopaholic, these items were accumulated over a 6 month period of time. A few of these items were birthday gifts but since it was during the shelter in place, I’ve included them in this post. 

This isn‘t a list of the best of the best but my kid liked this stuff and continues to play with it today eventhough she’s been back to school for a month now. All I know that this kid better not say she’s bored every again.

### Toys & games

I tried to get more of the activities that she like but also some educational toys and games to keep up some “academics” while school was closed.

1. Blocks: We love these [Guidecraft Jr. Rainbow Blocks](https://amzn.to/34PWRMj). My kid never really got into building withregular wooden blocks but she liked these at the library so when her birthday came up, we put this on her wishlist. The set is small but you can build quite a few things with it. They’re especially fun because they have colorful transparent panel in the middle of the block. My kid likes to hold it up to her eyes as “glasses”. Not its intended use but she’s playing with it!  [](https://amzn.to/34PWRMj)
2. Puzzles: I’m a sucker for non-gaudy puzzle graphics. Some of these are shaped which make them doubly adorable. We have mama & kiddo puzzle time where we each do our own puzzles. I love it. We have the ones listed below.

   * [Mudpuppy Fire Truck Shaped Mini Puzzle](https://amzn.to/2YTIZN8)
   * [Mudpuppy Rainbow Lion Shaped Mini Puzzle](https://amzn.to/3lCA2l6)
   * [Mudpuppy Panther Chameleon Mini Puzzle](https://amzn.to/3lE23Zx)
   * [Mudpuppy Tyrannosaurus Rex Mini Puzzle](https://amzn.to/3lD6tA7)
   * [Andy Warhol Wood Puzzle Set](https://amzn.to/2FGndWv)
   * [Playhouse Assorted Donuts 24-Piece Die Cut Shaped Mini Puzzle](https://amzn.to/35JMIkz)
   * [Playhouse Tabby Kitten 25-Piece Die-Cut Shaped Mini Puzzle](https://amzn.to/3hE098f)
3. Educational Electronic Games: This [Square Panda Multisensory Phonics Playset](https://amzn.to/3jxwjU4) was recommended by a mom on a parent app and my kid loves it because it’s interactive with interchangeable letters that you place on a board. The games are fun with adorable characters. And I actually think she’s learning how to read from it.  [](https://amzn.to/3jxwjU4)
4. Art kits: While I usually piece meal our kid art activities, sometimes mama is tired so I pull out one of these [Crayola Paint Your Own Figurines ](https://amzn.to/2YBKa3A) kits where my kid can work independently. 
5. Jewelry Stand: This [LEGO DOTS Rainbow Jewelry Stand](https://amzn.to/3hsc2ia) was a birthday gift and I love it because it’s such a fun alternative to a music jewelry box. And it’s LEGO! [](https://amzn.to/3hsc2ia)
6. Light Box: This [LED Light Box for Tracing](https://amzn.to/2YEH6E9) was another birthday gift. I put it on kiddo’s wishlist because it’s something that we both can use. I use it for tracing drawings onto watercolor paper. She does tracing on it too but it also doubles as a cheaper alternative to a traditional light box which sometimes is $$$. [](https://amzn.to/2YEH6E9)
7. Pattern Blocks: These [Constructive Playthings Toys Translucent Pattern Blocks](https://amzn.to/2Qrw2FR) are much cooler than solid pattern blocks and they go so well with the light box. [](https://amzn.to/2Qrw2FR)
8. Non-messy Coloring Pad: This [Melissa & Doug Water Wow](https://amzn.to/3ljAyo1) is probably a standard for most kids. My kid likes it because it’s ”magic”. [](https://amzn.to/3ljAyo1)
9. Window Suncatchers: In this [Made By Me Create Your Own Window Art](https://amzn.to/3lnMntd) set you get premade plastic designs. It comes with cool looking puffy paint that dries transparent. An easky way that you can paint your own suncatchers. 
10. Giant Bubbles: These [WOWMAZING Giant Bubble Kit](https://amzn.to/34zG2oC) bubbles are super thick and get so big! I’ve had neighbors 3-4 blocks away tell us they saw our giant bubbles floating in the sky. All you need is a bucket, some dishsoap and water.  [](https://amzn.to/34zG2oC)
11. Educational Card Game: This cool counting card deck [Tiny Polka Dot](https://amzn.to/32CpiMo) comes with a insturctions on how to play a bunch of games that teach counting and early math. [](https://amzn.to/32CpiMo)
12. Reading/Alphabet Game: My kid likes puzzles and she likes those educational reading game apps. And let's be real, kiddo was already watching 2 hours of shows/movies. I needed a way to reduce screen time and this [Melissa & Doug See and Spell](https://amzn.to/3muKWd6) has been a hit. However, I do with they had extra packs of words since there's only a dozen. This may be a toy that only lasts for a season but it was worth it.  [](https://amzn.to/3muKWd6)
13. Fine Motor Toys: This [GILI Flower Garden Building Toys](https://amzn.to/300GgCr) was a gift and it's one of those toys that is simple but that's the part that makes them so great. They're colorful, sturdy construction, and there's so many configurations for different types of flowers. Confession: I play with them too.

### Miscellaneous

Lastly, I wanted kiddo to have non-fussy fun. Nothing like playing pretend and getting some movement in to elevate positive mood.

1. Dramatic play/Dress up: My kid loves imaginative play more than anything else. So, I beefed up her selection costumes and accessories with these items.

   * [Dazzler Ribbon](https://amzn.to/2E754ke)
   * [Butterfly Wings](https://amzn.to/2FzaJjG)
   * [Dragon Cape](https://amzn.to/2FKlzTG)
   * [Elsa Jelly Shoes](https://amzn.to/3hDUIpQ)
2. Balance Board: This [Kinderfeet Balance board](https://amzn.to/2ZJEjKu) was something I wanted to add as a way help get the wiggles and angst out while indoors. My kid has used it as a slide, seesaw, and put a pillow on it to make it a ”bed”. Luckily, grandpa got it as a present for her birthday because it’s quite pricey but I think it’s worth it. It’s solid wood.
3. Trampoline: This [](https://amzn.to/2ZIvmRv)[ATIVAFIT 36-Inch Folding Trampoline](https://amzn.to/2ZIvmRv) was an impulse buy has more than paid for itself with the amount of use it has gotten. This was is nice and sturdy. Not truly foldable, you have to remove cover to break it down, but for us not a deal breaker.
