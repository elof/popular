So I don’t know about you but when my kid’s preschool announced immediate closure due to COVID in March, my gut reaction was a four letter expletive. At this point, she had been in school for nearly 2 years full time. What in the world were we going to do at home? There was simply too much time and not enough to do. I‘m being facetious but I figured a little toy refresh was in order because these are weird times. The usual new toys only on birthdays and Christmas rule went out the door. 

She lamented on and on about how she missed her friends. So, I went on a bit of a spending spree and got her some new stuff that would give her some focused activity and a pick me up. Let’s be real, little kids have short attention spans and I wasn’t expecting hours and hours of independent play but I was hoping for enough time to drink my coffee warm or do a little social media browsing. 

So, I present to you my pandemic toy, game, and activity haul. So you don’t think l’m a crazy shopaholic, these items were accumulated over a 6 month period of time. A few of these items were  birthday gifts but since it was during the shelter in place, I’ve included them in this post. 

This isn‘t a spectacular list of the best of the best but my kid liked this stuff and continues to play with it today eventhough she’s been back to school for a month now. All I know that this kid better not say she’s bored every again. 

### Toys, games, and miscellaneous

1. Blocks: We love these [Guidecraft Jr. Rainbow Blocks](https://amzn.to/34PWRMj). My kid never really got into building with blocks but she liked these at the library so when her birthday came up, we put this on her wishlist. The set is small but you can build quite a few things with it. They’re especially fun because they have transparent color in the middle of the block. My kid likes to hold it up to her eyes as “glasses”. Not its intended use but she’s playing with it!  [](https://amzn.to/34PWRMj)
2. Puzzles: I’m weird about puzzles. I hate ugly graphics. I mean, kids don’t care but if I have to do puzzles with my kid every so often I want them to be cute. LOL. Mudpuppy puzzles are adorable. Some of these are shaped which make them doubly adorable.

3. Educational Electronic Games: This [Square Panda Multisensory Phonics Playset](https://amzn.to/3jxwjU4) was recommended by a mom on a parent app and my kid loves it because it’s interactive with interchangeable letters that you place on a board. The games are fun with adorable characters. And I actually think she’s learning how to read from it.  [](https://amzn.to/3jxwjU4)
4. Art kits: While I usually piece meal our kid art activities, sometimes mama is tired so I pull out one of these kits where my kid can work independently.  [Crayola Paint Your Own Figurines ](https://amzn.to/2YBKa3A)
5. Jewelry Stand: This was a birthday gift and I love it because it’s such a fun alternative to a music jewelry box. And it’s LEGO! [LEGO DOTS Rainbow Jewelry Stand](https://amzn.to/3hsc2ia)
6. Light Box: This was another birthday gift. I put it on kiddo’s wishlist because it’s something that we both can use. I use it for tracing drawings onto watercolor paper. She does tracing on it too but it also doubles as a cheaper alternative to a traditional light box which sometimes is $$$. [LED Light Box for Tracing](https://amzn.to/2YEH6E9)
7. Pattern Blocks: Much cooler than solid pattern blocks and they go so well with the light box. [Constructive Playthings Toys Translucent Pattern Blocks](https://amzn.to/2Qrw2FR)
8. Non-messy Coloring Pad: This is probably a standard for most kids. My kid likes it because it’s ”magic”. [Melissa & Doug Water Wow](https://amzn.to/3ljAyo1)
9. [Made By Me Create Your Own Window Art](https://amzn.to/3lnMntd)  In this set you get premade plastic designs. It comes with cool looking puffy paint that dries transparent. An easky way that you can paint your own suncatchers. 
10. Giant Bubbles: These bubbles are super thick and get so big! I’ve had neighbors 3-4 blocks away tell us they saw our giant bubbles floating in the sky. All you need is a bucket, some dishsoap and water.  [WOWMAZING Giant Bubble Refill Powder Mix](https://amzn.to/34zG2oC)
