title: Paper plate Witches Hats
---
We're going to continue with the Halloween theme and make these adorable witches hats today. Years ago I got this Halloween book for my kid. It was called [Trick or Treat, Smell my Feet by Lisa Desimini](https://www.amazon.com/Trick-Treat-Smell-my-Feet/dp/0439233232/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2UUYAZKWNEQ27&dchild=1&keywords=trick+or+treat+smell+my+feet+book&qid=1602264722&sprefix=trick+or+treat+smell+m%2Caps%2C312&sr=8-4). This was way before she could walk or talk but I just remember it from my preschool teaching days and couldn't help myself. It was about two witches who cast a spell on a town to ruin trick or treating for the children in the neighborhood. It's actually funnier than it sounds.
