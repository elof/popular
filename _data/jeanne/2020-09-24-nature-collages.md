#### Supplies:

* Contact Paper
* Leafs, flower petals, and other foliage

#### Steps:

1. If possible go on a hike and try to collect items that way. We didn't have the time to do that so we just took a stroll around the block and got flower petals and leaves that way.

2. Prepare your contact paper. Cut any size you want from the roll, we ended up cutting a sheet that was 24" long (the width is fixed). Now, fold it in half length wise so your the overall measurement is 12x17".

3. Peel off half of the protective film to expose the sticky side of contact paper.

4. Now arrange your flowers and leaves in whatever design you'd like. Make sure you leave about 1/4" margin on all sides so that you can seal the edges later.

5. When you're happy with your design take the protective film off the other side and seal the flowers in by pressing down on top and removing as much air bubbles as possible.
