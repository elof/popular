We absolutely love the brand Kid Made Modern. Whenever I am at Target I just have to browse the colorful aisle of thoughtful and fun arts and crafts items from this brand. And when I found out [Todd Oldham](https://www.toddoldhamstudio.com/portfolio/kid-made-modern/) was the founder of Kid Made Modern, I was super stoked. I remember him from his days on MTV’s House of Style. Anyone else? Ok, maybe I’ve just dated myself. Anyway, my mom friend Sara told me about this [Kid Made Modern Spinner Kit](https://www.target.com/p/pine-oval-spinner-hand-made-modern-174/-/A-50364232#lnk=sametab) and I got one for me and one for the kid. Super simple to make, you just unscrew it and paint the pieces separately, then screw it all back together when dry.

We used liquid watercolor which yielded a lovely result but I didn’t think about how the wood would expand with moisture. Whoops! We had to remove a middle piece to be able to put the spinner back together. Stick to acrylic paint, people. Regardless, in the end it came out so pretty! It comes with an S hook for hanging.

Let me know if you tried this too. We can’t wait to try more of the Kid Made Modern kits.
