We're coming up to the home stretch of October and Halloween is tamer this year but we had lots of fun putting up our store bought and homemade decorations. This is probably the last Halloween craft we'll do and then we're moving onto fall then holiday art. I still need to finish making my halloween costume for our family themed costumes. Definitely slacking this year, I blame Covid. 

We always have a stockpile of egg cartons and paper plates so this idea came to me while trying to purge. There's a bunch of steps and you might have to break up the activity into a couple days but the result is just so cool. I think it's worth it. 

Anyway, enough talking and onto the making...

#### Supplies needed:

* Paper plate
* Egg carton
* Yarn
* Masking tape
* Googly eyes

#### Steps:

1. Cut up your egg cartons and paint that and the paper plate black.

2. Punch holes around the paper plate and egg cartons.

3. Tape a piece of yarn onto the back of paper plate to hold it in place so you can start weaving your spider web. Make your spider web then tape off in the back when done.

4. Grab 4 pipe cleaners. Cut them in half and stick them through the holes in the egg cartons.
